############# TEMPORAL ANALYSIS ############# 

#create temporal data frame & graph it

dorianTweetsByHour <- ts_data(dorian, by="hours")

############# NETWORK ANALYSIS ############# 

# Create network data frame. 
# Other options for 'edges' in the network include mention, retweet, and reply
dorianNetwork <- network_graph(dorian, c("quote"))

plot.igraph(dorianNetwork)
# This graph needs serious work... e.g. subset to a single state maybe?

############### UPLOAD RESULTS TO POSTGIS DATABASE ###############

# Connecting to Postgres
# Create a con database connection with the dbConnect function.
# Change the user and password to your own!
con <- dbConnect(RPostgres::Postgres(), 
                 dbname='dsm', 
                 host='artemis', 
                 user='user', 
                 password='password') 

#list the database tables, to check if the database is working
dbListTables(con) 

#create a simple table for uploading
doriansql <- select(dorian,c("user_id","status_id","text","lat","lng"),
                    starts_with("place"))

#write data to the database
dbWriteTable(con,'dorian',doriansql, overwrite=TRUE)

# try also writing the november tweet data to the database! Add code below:

# write counties table with lower-case column names to the database
dbWriteTable(con,'counties',lownames(counties), overwrite=TRUE)


############### SPATIAL JOIN AND MAPPING NORMALIZED TWEETS ###############

# Either in R or in PostGIS (via QGIS DB Manager)...

# Count the number of dorian points in each county
# Count the number of november points in each county
# Set counties with no points to 0 for the november count
# Calculate the normalized difference tweet index (made this up, based on NDVI), 
# where ndti = (tweets about storm â€“ baseline twitter activity) / 
#              (tweets about storm + baseline twitter activity)
# remember to multiply something by 1.0 so that you'll get decimal division
# also if the denominator would end up being 0, set the result to 0

# See 03-spatial-join.sql for tips on managing the data in PostGIS

# Either in QGIS or in R...
# Map the normalized tweet difference index for Hurricane Dorian
# Try using the heatmap symbology in QGIS to visualize kernel density of tweets


############### SAVE RESULTS FROM POSTGIS SPATIAL JOIN ###############

# pull results back from the database, replacing 'tablename' with the name
# of table with results at county level
county_tweets = dbReadTable(con, "tablename")

# save county-level results to derived/public
saveRDS(county_tweets, here("data","derived","public","county_tweets.RDS"))

#disconnect from the database
dbDisconnect(con)
