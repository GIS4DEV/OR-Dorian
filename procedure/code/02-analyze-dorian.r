#to do anything, you first need a twitter API token: https://rtweet.info/articles/auth.html 

#install packages for twitter, census, data management, and mapping

############# TEMPORAL ANALYSIS ############# 

#this is here as an example. change to the dorian3 data you processed in the previous script to try...

#create temporal data frame & graph it

dorian <- ts_data(dorian, by="hours")
ts_plot(dorian, by="hours")

############# NETWORK ANALYSIS ############# 

#this is here as an example. change to the dorian3 data you processed in the previous script to try...

#create network data frame. Other options for 'edges' in the network include mention, retweet, and reply
dorianNetwork <- network_graph(dorian, c("quote"))

plot.igraph(winterTweetNetwork)
#Please, this is incredibly ugly... if you finish early return to this function and see if we can modify its parameters to improve aesthetics

############# TEXT / CONTEXTUAL ANALYSIS ############# 

#remove urls, fancy formatting, etc. in other words, clean the text content

#parse out words from tweet text
dorianWords = dorianText %>% unnest_tokens(word, text)

# how many words do you have including the stop words?

#create list of stop words (useless words) and add "t.co" twitter links to the list
data("stop_words")
stop_words = stop_words %>% add_row(word="t.co",lexicon = "SMART")

#delete stop words from dorianWords with an anti_join
dorianWords =  dorianWords %>% anti_join(stop_words) 

# how many words after removing the stop words?
count(dorianWords)

# graph frequencies of words

dorianWordPairs = dorianWordPairs %>% count(word1, word2, sort=TRUE)

# graph a word cloud with space indicating association.
# you may change the filter to filter more or less than pairs with 30 instances

############# SPATIAL ANALYSIS #############

############### UPLOAD RESULTS TO POSTGIS DATABASE ###############

#Connectign to Postgres
#Create a con database connection with the dbConnect function.
#Change the user and password to your own!
con <- dbConnect(RPostgres::Postgres(), dbname='dsm', host='artemis', user='user', password='password') 

#list the database tables, to check if the database is working
dbListTables(con) 

#create a simple table for uploading
doriansql <- select(dorian,c("user_id","status_id","text","lat","lng"),starts_with("place"))

#write data to the database
dbWriteTable(con,'dorian',doriansql, overwrite=TRUE)

# try also writing the november tweet data to the database! Add code below:

# SQL to add geometry column of type point and crs NAD 1983: 
# SELECT AddGeometryColumn ('schemaname','dorian','geom',4269,'POINT',2, false);
# SQL to calculate geometry:
# UPDATE dorian set geom = st_transform(st_makepoint(lng,lat),4326,4269);

#make all lower-case names for counties, because PostGreSQL is not into capitalization

dbWriteTable(con,'counties',lownames(counties), overwrite=TRUE)

#disconnect from the database
dbDisconnect(con)

############### SPATIAL JOIN AND MAPPING NORMALIZED TWEETS ###############

# Either in R or in PostGIS (via QGIS DB Manager)...

# Count the number of dorian points in each county
# Count the number of november points in each county
# Set counties with no points to 0 for the november count
# Calculate the normalized difference tweet index (made this up, based on NDVI), where
# ndti = (tweets about storm â€“ baseline twitter activity) / (tweets about storm + baseline twitter activity)
# remember to multiply something by 1.0 so that you'll get decimal devision, not integer division
# also if the denominator would end up being 0, set the result to 0

# Either in QGIS or in R...
# Map the normalized tweet difference index for Hurricane Dorian
# Try using the heatmap symbology in QGIS to visualize kernel density of tweets

############### CREATE YOUR OWN TWITTER QUERY ###############

# Before next Lab, make a copy of the 01-search-dorian.r script and modify it to query your own set of data from Twitter and prepare it for mapping just as we have done here!
# Remember that you may have to let the query run for a few hours if there are a high number of results.
